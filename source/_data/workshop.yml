    description_long: "Designing good React components that can help the team steadily build reliable features while maintaining a quality codebase is not an easy feat.
    <br> <br />
    <b>In this workshop of 8 hours, we’re gonna cover principles of good architecture and how to apply them to a real-world React use case.</b>
    <br> <br />
    Throughout the workshop, we’re gonna development a sandbox application and explore how to design good React software. Topics include decomposing UI complexity into proper components, enforcing business rules in the type system, composing asynchronous side-effects and testing everything of course.
    <br> <br />"

        teacher_bio: "I’m currently working remotely as Front-end Consultant and Trainer. I’ve spent countless hours writing TypeScript and React for a variety of companies located in Europe. Likewise I’ve taught many people how to write good software in TS and React, or at least I’ve tried.
I enjoy spending time chatting in the Italian JS communities and I speak sometimes at public tech events. In my spare time, I enjoy reading Baricco or Murakami and experimenting in the kitchen. Or just chilling somewhere with fresh air."
